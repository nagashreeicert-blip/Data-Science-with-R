# 🟡 Beginner Level – 10 Questions
1. What is Data Science?

Answer:
Data Science is the field of extracting insights from data using statistics, programming, and machine learning.

2. What is R?

Answer:
R is an open-source programming language widely used for statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning.

3. What is a Data Frame in R?

Answer:
A data frame is a table-like structure where each column can contain different data types.

4. How do you read a CSV file in R?

Answer:
Using: read.csv("file.csv")

5. What are Vectors in R?

Answer:
A vector is a one-dimensional array containing elements of the same data type.

6. What is ggplot2?

Answer:
A powerful visualization package used for creating advanced and layered graphs in R.

7. What is NA in R?

Answer:
NA represents missing or undefined data.

8. What is the apply() function used for?

Answer:
It applies a function over rows or columns of matrices/data frames.

9. What is the difference between list and vector?

Answer:

Vector: Same data type

List: Can store mixed data types

10. What is a Factor variable?

Answer:
A categorical variable stored as levels (labels) used for classification.

# 🔵 Intermediate Level – 10 Questions
11. What is dplyr in R?

Answer:
A data manipulation package providing functions like filter, mutate, summarise, select.

12. How do you handle missing values?

Answer:
Using:

na.omit()

is.na()

Imputation (mean/median/mode)

13. Difference between sample() and subset()?

Answer:

sample() → randomly selects items

subset() → filters based on conditions

14. What is a correlation matrix?

Answer:
A table showing correlation coefficients between variables.

15. What is tidyverse?

Answer:
A collection of R packages for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis (dplyr, ggplot2, readr, tidyr).

16. What is logistic regression used for?

Answer:
Predicting binary outcomes (yes/no, 0/1).

17. What is train-test split?

Answer:
Dividing data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

18. What is overfitting?

Answer:
When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new (test) data.

19. What is PCA?

Answer:
Principal Component Analysis — reduces dimensionality while retaining variance.

20. What is a confusion matrix?

Answer:
A table showing actual vs predicted outcomes to evaluate classification models.

21. What is Cross-validation?

Answer:
A technique (like k-fold) used to validate model performance on different subsets.

22. What is a Random Forest?

Answer:
An ensemble learning method using multiple decision trees to improve accuracy.

23. What is R squared?

Answer:
A metric that shows how well a model explains the variance in the dependent variable.

24. What is Regularization?

Answer:
A method (Lasso, Ridge) to prevent overfitting by adding penalty terms.

25. What is a Time Series model?

Answer:
A model used for forecasting sequential data (ARIMA, ETS).

26. What is the caret package used for?

Answer:
Classification and Regression Training — provides easy machine learning workflows.

27. What is Gradient Boosting?

Answer:
A sequential ensemble method where each model learns from previous errors.

28. What is the purpose of feature scaling?

Answer:
To normalize data so all features contribute equally to model training.

29. What is an outlier?

Answer:
A data point significantly different from the majority; detected using IQR, z-score.

30. How do you evaluate a regression model in R?

Answer:
Using metrics like:

RMSE

MAE

R²

Residual plots
